    <h1>Bridal & Sagan HD Makeup </h1>
    <img src='Service/Bridall.jpg' alt=''>
    <p> HD makeup eliminates skin imperfections without making your face look blurry when compared to a standard finish.<br>  HD makeup is what most celebrities and international professional makeup artists swear by as it gives a very natural, non-cakey, soft and flawless look.<br>HD makeup looks sheer while hiding flaws such as uneven texture, blemishes, pores and scars.
      <br>  On your wedding day, you will be moving around constantly and getting your pictures taken. <br>You don’t want a finish that’ll make your skin’s imperfections stand out with the camera’s flash and you need something that’ll last throughout the function.
      <br>  HD makeup is the most common type of makeup, especially in the form of foundation and loose powder. The final finish is soft and natural rather than heavy
        </p>

    <h1>Bridal & Sagan Airbrush Makeup </h1>
    <img src='Service/Sagan.JPG' alt=''>
    <p>This is for the bride who wants to look and feel like herself but enhance her natural features. It can bring out the best you on your special day. <br>It uses the effects of light and dark to create a pleasing look. This makeup is meant to enhance the wearer’s features without being loud.<br> This look is achieved with minimal face powders along with illuminating, dewy-finish foundations and a minimum amount of highlighters
        It can hide the skin imperfections effectively giving a smooth and comfortable finish.
      <br>  The glowing, nude looks perfectly enhance your features without adding too much color to your visage for that ‘no makeup’ feel and goes perfectly with any attire or event.

    <h1>Pre Bridal Services</h1>
    <img src='Service/Pre Bridal.JPEG''>
    <p> Pre-bridal sessions are all about body cleaning, getting extra hair waxed, exfoliating skin, and even making sure your nails are glossed to perfection.<br> A bride-to-be  should start these sessions at least 2 months prior to the wedding.

      <br>  Certain sessions such as facials, laser treatments or any type of hair color and straightening also come under the umbrella of pre- bridal sessions.<br> One should always take assistance of dermatologist to go ahead with these sessions. So indulge from top to bottom to bring out a stunning you!  </p>
